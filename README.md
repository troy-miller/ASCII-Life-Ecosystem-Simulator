# ASCII-Life-Ecosystem-Simulator

Implementation of a small and simple ecosystem of rabbits using ASCII graphics (uses Trystan Spangler's AsciiPanel library https://github.com/trystan/AsciiPanel). Rabbits require food and water to survive and can reproduce if those needs are met.

Features:
- Mess with numbers in the start screen to create different types of simulations: initial number of rabbits, plants, and plant spawn rate can be altered
- Speed up/slow down and pause simulation
- View current number of rabbits, time passed, and causes of deaths of rabbits
- Select individual rabbits to see their current stats: age, gender, and urge to either drink, eat, or reproduce

Planned features:
- Predators (most likely foxes): allows for tracking and understanding how adding another animal into the ecosystem might throw everything off balance/create a new balance
- Genetics: giving rabbits genes would allow the user to track which ones (maybe speed or stomach size) prove to be useful in a competitive environment
